# Dice
#####Hello there
Dice is little game.<br> First you need to start with "start-program.bat" then you can choose how many
sides the two dices will have.<br>
The program will roll both dices and sum them up. Now you guess the outcome.<br>
**----You need to enter a number!---<br>**
If you didn´t guess right the program tells you if the outcome is higher or lower than your guess.<br> It
also asks you if you want guess again.<br> If you want type "y" for Yes or "n" for No.<br> 
**Note: If enter something other than "y" or "n" the program reveals the outcome and crashes.<br>**
If you don´t want to guess again the outcome is revealed and you can throw the dices again if you want.<br>
If you don´t want to play anymore type "n" instead of "y" and the program exits.
